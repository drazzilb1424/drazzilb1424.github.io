              etc.<br>

            <li>You are required to cover shipping to and from us. There will be an additional $5 flat fee for this - no

        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span><b><u>How to Prepare Your Cards</u></b>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>All cards must be in a <strong>penny sleeve and CardSaver</strong> (Semi Rigid Card Holder) as requested
              by PSA. You may use a top loader instead when sending to us, but to ensure safety in transit and at PSA,
              as well as <strong>avoiding delays</strong>, we will place them into a Semi Rigid for you which comes with
              an <strong>upcharge of $.25 per</strong>.<br>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>We will handle getting the card information and coming up with aÂ <i>max insured value</i>Â but
                pleaseÂ </span><b><u>do your own research</u></b><span>Â so you know what service level to use. It's ok to
                submit cards that may be slightly more than the insured value, just keep in mind that PSA has the right
                to upcharge any card exceeding theÂ <i>max insured value</i>Â for the selected tier and that fee
                isÂ </span><b><u>covered by you</u></b><span>. For example, if you submit a $500 card in a Base
                submission where the max insured value is $200 , PSA will most likely upcharge you and you are
                responsible for this cost. We will contact you in advance if there is an upcharge and the change will be
                reflected on your invoice.</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2><b><u>Payment</u></b></h2>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li><span>All payments will be made through Square. You will receive an invoice with the exact amount to
                pay. SquareÂ is a more versatile platform that will allow you to pay with simpler options such as a
                Credit or Debit Card most notably, as well as Google Pay, Apple Pay and Cash App.</span></li>
            <li><span>You will not have to pay until PSA has officially provided the card with a grade and charged us
                for the service, which happens roughly a week or two before the cards are being shipped back to us. We
                will send an invoice via Square to your email to notify you that your cards are on their way back. Grade
                results are provided via request and only after your order has been paid for in full.<br></span></li>
            <li>Return shipping is something calculated directly from PSA and can range anywhere from $30 - $100+
              depending on the order size. This cost will include insured shipping viaÂ <a
                href="https://www.fedex.com/en-us/shipping/express.html#what">FedEx Express</a> who only delivers
              Monday-Friday. We will not know the cost until PSA has shipped the cards back to us. This charge will be
              divided between everyone in the submission on a per card basis.</li>
            <li>
              <span>For orders being shipped from us to you, there will be an additional <strong>$</strong></span><b>5
                flat fee</b><span>Â for this - no matter the order size. You will receive an email with tracking once we
                ship your slabs back to you. Expected turnaround time from us receiving the order from PSA to shipping
                to you will be no longer than two business days.</span>
            </li>
            <li>If you need to update your address at any point, please email us and we can change it on our
              end.<span></span>
